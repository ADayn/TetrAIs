### Description
We are going to make a website where users can play Tetris in their browsers. They will be able to view past high scores and save a username for that play to store past plays and display them on the leaderboard. We will use Tensor-flow to learn an AI to play Tetris at the same time as the user, so users can play against the AI in realtime. The value we provide is to provide ultimate competitive environment, so the AI always gets better, continuously forcing the user to get better if they want to keep up.

### Vision Statement
TODO

### Motivation
To learn about machine learning and tensor-flow, and to create an awesome game.

### Risks
AI might not work / Might take too long to learn the game.
Lack of experience with Front end Dev and Machine learning

### Risk Mitigation Plan
We will start on the AI as soon as possible to reduce the risk of not having enough time for the algorithm to converge on an optimal solution and to maximize the time we have to get familiar with the problem.

### VC
Github

### Dev Methodology
Agile
